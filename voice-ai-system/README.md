   - Command history and analytics

### Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome/Edge**: Full support (recommended)
- **Firefox**: Full support with some API differences
- **Safari**: Limited support (iOS requires user gesture)
- **Mobile browsers**: Varies by platform and browser

### Prerequisites

- Modern web browser with Web Speech API support
- Microphone access permission
- HTTPS connection (required for microphone access)

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone or download** the project files
2. **Serve the files** using a web server (required for microphone access):
   ```bash
   # Using Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js (with serve package)
   npx serve .
   
   # Using PHP
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```
3. **Open** `https://localhost:8000` in your browser
4. **Grant microphone permission** when prompted
5. **Click "Start Listening"** to begin voice control

## Usage Guide

### Getting Started
1. Open the application in a supported browser
2. Grant microphone permissions when prompted
3. Click the "Start Listening" button
4. Speak naturally using the supported voice commands
5. Watch the audio visualizer for real-time feedback

### Voice Settings Configuration
- **Voice Selection**: Choose from available system voices
- **Pitch Control**: Adjust voice pitch (0.5 - 2.0)
- **Speech Rate**: Control speaking speed (0.5 - 2.0)
- **Confidence Threshold**: Set recognition sensitivity (0.5 - 1.0)

### Best Practices
- Speak clearly and at a moderate pace
- Use natural language - the system understands variations
- Wait for visual feedback before issuing new commands
- Check the command history for recognition accuracy
- Adjust confidence threshold if having recognition issues

## API Reference

### VoiceAISystem Class

```javascript
// Initialize the system
const voiceAI = new VoiceAISystem();

// Test voice commands programmatically
await voiceAI.testVoiceCommand("play video");

// Get system status
const status = voiceAI.getSystemStatus();

// Speak text directly
await voiceAI.speak("Hello, this is a test");

// Start/stop listening manually
await voiceAI.startListening();
voiceAI.stopListening();
```

### Command Processing Flow

1. **Audio Input** ‚Üí Speech Recognition Engine
2. **Transcript** ‚Üí Natural Language Understanding
3. **Intent + Entities** ‚Üí Media Controller
4. **Action Result** ‚Üí Speech Synthesis (feedback)
5. **History Logging** ‚Üí Command History Display

## Customization

### Adding New Commands

1. **Define Intent Patterns** in `nlu-engine.js`:
   ```javascript
   NEW_COMMAND: {
       patterns: [
           /^(new|custom)\s+command$/i,
           /^do\s+something\s+new$/i
       ],
       examples: ['new command', 'do something new']
   }
   ```

2. **Implement Handler** in `media-controller.js`:
   ```javascript
   case 'NEW_COMMAND':
       return this.handleNewCommand();
   ```

3. **Add Voice Feedback** in `speech-synthesis.js`:
   ```javascript
   async speakNewCommand() {
       return this.speak("New command executed successfully");
   }
   ```

### Extending Media Controls

The `MediaController` class can be extended to support additional media types:

```javascript
// Add support for audio playlists
addPlaylistSupport() {
    // Implementation for playlist controls
}

// Add support for streaming services
addStreamingSupport() {
    // Implementation for streaming API integration
}
```

## Performance Optimization

- **Audio Context Management**: Automatically suspends when not in use
- **Canvas Rendering Optimization**: Uses requestAnimationFrame for smooth visuals
- **Memory Management**: Limits command history and cleans up resources
- **Event Debouncing**: Prevents excessive processing during continuous input
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and device capabilities

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Microphone Access Denied**
   - Ensure HTTPS connection
   - Check browser permissions settings
   - Try refreshing the page and granting permission again

2. **Speech Recognition Not Working**
   - Verify browser compatibility
   - Check microphone hardware
   - Adjust confidence threshold in settings

3. **Commands Not Recognized**
   - Speak more clearly
   - Try alternative command phrases
   - Check command history for patterns
   - Lower confidence threshold

4. **Audio Visualization Not Showing**
   - Ensure microphone permission is granted
   - Check browser console for WebGL/Canvas errors
   - Try refreshing the page

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by opening browser developer tools. The system provides comprehensive logging for:
- Speech recognition events
- Command processing steps
- Media control actions
- Audio processing status

## Security Considerations

- **Microphone Privacy**: Audio is processed locally, never sent to external servers
- **HTTPS Required**: Secure connection needed for microphone access
- **Permission Management**: Users have full control over microphone access
- **Local Processing**: All speech recognition and synthesis occurs in the browser
