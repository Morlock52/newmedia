- Modern monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager)
- Media applications (AudioBookshelf, Navidrome, Immich)
- Request management (Overseerr)

✅ **Current 2025 Standards**
- Latest container versions
- Professional compose structure with YAML anchors
- Proper volume management

## Critical Issues Identified & Solutions

### 1. Network Architecture Problems

**Issues:**
- Mixed access patterns (direct ports vs proxy-only)
- SSL/certificate issues with localhost domain
- Service accessibility inconsistencies

**Solutions Implemented:**
- Created macOS-optimized configuration with consistent port mapping
- Unified access strategy using .localhost domains
- Removed problematic Traefik SSL for local development

### 2. macOS Docker Limitations

**Issues:**
- VPN container failing with route errors on macOS
- Hardware acceleration unavailable in Docker containers
- cAdvisor compatibility issues

**Solutions:**
- Removed Gluetun VPN container (use system-level VPN instead)
- Simplified network architecture for macOS compatibility
- Disabled cAdvisor for macOS deployment
- Documented hardware acceleration alternatives

### 3. Service Accessibility

**Issues:**
- Many services only accessible via broken proxy configuration
- Inconsistent URL patterns
- Complex certificate management for local development

**Solutions:**
- Added direct port mappings for all services
- Consistent localhost-based URLs
- Simplified Traefik configuration without SSL for local use

## Specific Improvements Implemented

### Network Architecture Improvements

```yaml
# Before: Complex multi-network setup with VPN routing
networks:
  - frontend
  - backend  
  - download_network
  - monitoring
  - database

# After: Simplified single network for macOS
networks:
  frontend:
    driver: bridge
```

### Service Accessibility Fixes

- qBittorrent: `http://localhost:8081`
- SABnzbd: `http://localhost:8082`
- Radarr: `http://localhost:7878`
- Sonarr: `http://localhost:8989`
- Prowlarr: `http://localhost:9696`
- AudioBookshelf: `http://localhost:13378`
- Navidrome: `http://localhost:4533`

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Resource Limit Optimization**
   - Removed unnecessary security constraints for development
   - Simplified health checks for faster startup
   - Optimized memory allocation

2. **Storage Efficiency**
   - Configured for hardlink support
   - Optimized volume mounting for media access

3. **macOS-Specific Optimizations**
   - Removed VPN networking that causes routing issues
   - Simplified container networking
   - Disabled problematic monitoring components

### Security Enhancements (Development-Focused)

1. **Simplified Authentication**
   - Removed complex certificate management
   - Basic auth for administrative interfaces
   - Docker socket protection maintained

2. **Network Security**
   - Maintained service isolation where possible
   - Removed unnecessary network complexity
   - Kept essential monitoring capabilities

## User Experience Improvements

### 1. Unified Dashboard Access

Created Homepage dashboard at `http://localhost:3000` with:
- One-click access to all services
- Service status indicators
- Organized by function (Media, Management, Download, Monitoring)

### 2. Consistent URL Patterns

All services follow `http://localhost:PORT` pattern:
- No complex domain configuration required
- Immediate access after deployment
- Predictable port assignments

### 3. Simplified Deployment

**New Deployment Script:** `deploy-macos-optimized.sh`
- One-command deployment
- Automatic directory creation
- Configuration file generation
- Service health verification

## Monitoring and Observability

### Implemented Monitoring Stack

1. **Prometheus** (`localhost:9090`)
   - Container metrics collection
   - Service health monitoring
   - Custom alerting rules

2. **Grafana** (`localhost:3001`)
   - Pre-configured dashboards
   - Performance visualizations
   - Alert management

3. **Homepage Dashboard** (`localhost:3000`)
   - Service status overview
   - Quick access links
   - Health indicators

### Health Check Implementation

All services include:
- Startup health verification
- Automatic restart policies
- Dependency management
- Resource monitoring

## Backup and Recovery

### Current Backup Strategy

**Duplicati Integration** (`localhost:8200`):
- Automated configuration backups
- Media metadata preservation
- Scheduled backup tasks
- Cloud storage integration support

### Recommended Backup Approach

1. **Configuration Data**
   - All container configs in `config/` directory
   - Database backups for *arr applications
   - Jellyfin library metadata

2. **Media Data**
   - Media files in `data/media/`
   - Download history preservation
   - Custom metadata and artwork

## Migration from Current Setup

### Step 1: Data Preservation
```bash
# Backup current configurations
docker-compose -f docker-compose-2025-fixed.yml down
cp -r config/ config-backup/
cp -r data/ data-backup/
```

### Step 2: Deploy Optimized Stack
```bash
# Deploy macOS-optimized configuration
./deploy-macos-optimized.sh
```

### Step 3: Restore Configurations
```bash
# Copy existing configurations to new deployment
cp -r config-backup/* config/
docker-compose -f docker-compose-macos-optimized.yml restart
```

## Hardware Acceleration Alternatives

### macOS Limitations
- Docker containers cannot access VideoToolbox
- GPU sharing not supported on macOS
- Software transcoding only in containers

### Recommended Solutions

1. **Native Jellyfin Installation**
   - Install Jellyfin directly on macOS
   - Full VideoToolbox acceleration support
   - Use Docker for supporting services only

2. **Hybrid Deployment**
   - Native Jellyfin for transcoding performance
   - Dockerized *arr stack for automation
   - Shared storage between native and containerized apps

## Performance Optimization Recommendations

### 1. Storage Optimization

**Use Hardlinks for Media Management:**
```yaml
# In Radarr/Sonarr settings
Download Client: qBittorrent
Category: movies/tv
Completed Download Handling: Use Hardlinks
```

### 2. Resource Allocation

**Docker Desktop Settings:**
- Memory: 8GB minimum (16GB recommended)
- CPU: 4 cores minimum
- Disk: Use Docker Desktop storage backend

### 3. Network Performance

**Simplified Networking:**
- Single bridge network
- Direct port access
- Minimal proxy overhead

## Security Considerations

### Development vs Production

**Current Implementation (Development-Focused):**
- Simplified authentication
- Direct port access
- Local-only access

**Production Recommendations:**
- Implement proper SSL certificates
- Use external authentication (Authelia)
- Restrict network access
- Enable audit logging

## Future Improvements

### 1. Container Orchestration
- Consider Docker Swarm for scaling
- Implement proper secrets management
- Add container update automation

### 2. Advanced Monitoring
- Add application-specific metrics
- Implement log aggregation
- Create custom alerting rules

### 3. Media Pipeline Optimization
- Implement preview generation
- Add automatic quality upgrading
- Create custom import workflows

## Deployment Instructions

### Quick Start (Recommended)
```bash
cd /Users/morlock/fun/newmedia
./deploy-macos-optimized.sh
```

### Manual Deployment
```bash

```

### Access Services
- Dashboard: http://localhost:3000
- Jellyfin: http://localhost:8096

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port Conflicts**
   ```bash
   # Check for port usage
   lsof -i :8096
   # Kill conflicting processes if needed
   ```

2. **Permission Issues**
   ```bash
   # Fix volume permissions
   sudo chown -R $(id -u):$(id -g) data/ config/
   ```

3. **Service Startup Issues**
   ```bash
   # Check service logs
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-macos-optimized.yml logs [service_name]
   ```
