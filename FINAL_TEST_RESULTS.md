### ⚠️ **SERVICES NEEDING ATTENTION (5)**

The *arr services (Sonarr, Radarr, Prowlarr, Lidarr) appear to be running but not responding on expected ports. This is likely because:

1. They're still initializing (first-time setup can take several minutes)
2. They may be using different internal ports
3. They need initial configuration

**These services ARE running** as confirmed by Docker:
- Sonarr: Up 43 minutes
- Radarr: Up 43 minutes  
- Prowlarr: Up 43 minutes
- Lidarr: Up 43 minutes
- Traefik: Up 43 minutes

```bash
# Check if they're actually listening on different ports
docker exec sonarr netstat -tulpn | grep LISTEN
docker exec radarr netstat -tulpn | grep LISTEN

# View their logs for any errors
docker logs sonarr --tail 50
docker logs radarr --tail 50

# Restart them if needed
docker restart sonarr radarr prowlarr lidarr
```
