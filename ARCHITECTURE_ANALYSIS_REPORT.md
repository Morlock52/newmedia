## Network Architecture

### Network Segmentation
The architecture implements proper network isolation:

1. **DMZ Network (10.10.4.0/24)**
   - Internet-facing services
   - WAF and VPN gateway
   - DDoS protection

2. **Proxy Network (10.10.0.0/24)**
   - Traefik reverse proxy
   - Authelia authentication
   - HAProxy load balancer
   - CrowdSec security

3. **Media Network (10.10.1.0/24)**
   - All media streaming services
   - Content management services
   - Download clients

4. **Admin Network (10.10.2.0/24)**
   - Monitoring services
   - Management tools
   - Backup services

5. **Data Network (10.10.3.0/24)**
   - Databases
   - Caching layers
   - Storage systems

### Service Communication
- Internal services communicate via Docker networks
- External access routed through Traefik
- Service discovery handled by Docker DNS
- API gateway pattern for external APIs

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Authelia provides centralized authentication
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: TOTP, WebAuthn, backup codes
- **Session Management**: Redis-backed sessions
- **Access Control**: RBAC with user groups

### Security Layers
1. **Edge Security**: Cloudflare WAF & DDoS protection
2. **Network Security**: pfSense firewall with IDS/IPS
3. **Transport Security**: TLS 1.3 with Let's Encrypt certificates
4. **Application Security**: Service-level authentication
5. **Container Security**: Isolation and least-privilege principles
6. **Data Security**: Encryption at rest and in transit

### VPN Integration
- WireGuard for secure remote access
- Gluetun for VPN-routed downloads
- Split tunneling for optimal performance

## Performance Optimizations

### Hardware Acceleration
- **GPU Support**: NVIDIA NVENC, Intel QuickSync, AMD AMF
- **Transcoding**: Hardware-accelerated video processing
- **AI/ML**: GPU acceleration for Immich photo analysis

### Caching Strategy
- **L1 Cache**: Redis for session and metadata
- **L2 Cache**: SSD cache for frequently accessed media
- **L3 Cache**: CDN integration for static assets
- **Database Caching**: Query result caching

### Load Balancing
- HAProxy for service distribution
- Health checks every 10 seconds
- Sticky sessions for stateful services
- Round-robin for stateless services

## Data Flow Architecture

### Content Acquisition Flow
1. User request → Overseerr
2. Overseerr → *arr services (Sonarr/Radarr/etc)
3. *arr services → Prowlarr (indexer management)
4. Prowlarr → External indexers
5. Download client → Media storage
6. Post-processing → Media organization

### Streaming Flow
1. Client request → Traefik
2. Traefik → Authelia (authentication)
3. Authelia → Media service
4. Media service → Storage/Cache
5. Transcoding (if needed) → Client delivery

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- Services can be replicated for load distribution
- Database read replicas supported
- Distributed caching with Redis cluster
- Load balancer manages service instances

### Vertical Scaling
- Resource limits defined per service
- CPU and memory reservations
- GPU allocation for compute-intensive tasks
- Storage tiering for performance

## Configuration Management

### Environment-Based Configuration
- `.env` files for environment-specific settings
- Docker secrets for sensitive data
- Volume mounts for persistent configuration
- Dynamic configuration via Traefik

### Service Dependencies
- Proper dependency ordering in Docker Compose
- Health checks ensure service readiness
- Restart policies for resilience
- Graceful shutdown handling

## Monitoring & Observability

### Metrics Collection
- Prometheus scrapes all services
- Custom metrics for media-specific data
- Resource utilization tracking
- API performance monitoring

### Dashboards
- System overview dashboard
- Service-specific dashboards
- Media analytics dashboard
- Security event dashboard

### Alerting
- Service downtime alerts
- Resource threshold alerts
- Security incident alerts
- Backup failure notifications
