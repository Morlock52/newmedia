# Omega Media Server Architecture

## Overview

Omega Media Server is a revolutionary all-in-one media server solution that runs from a single Docker container while providing the functionality of 30+ separate applications. Built with 2025's latest technologies, it combines ease of use with enterprise-grade features.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Single Container Architecture
Unlike traditional media server setups that require multiple containers orchestrated through Docker Compose, Omega runs everything in a single container using:
- **Docker-in-Docker**: For internal service isolation
- **K3s**: Lightweight Kubernetes for service orchestration
- **S6-Overlay**: For process supervision and management

### 2. Progressive Enhancement
- Basic features work immediately upon startup
- Advanced features can be enabled through the web UI
- No manual configuration files needed
- Intelligent defaults based on system detection

### 3. AI-First Design
Every component integrates AI capabilities:
- **Content Analysis**: Automatic tagging, scene detection, face recognition
- **Recommendations**: Collaborative and content-based filtering
- **Voice Control**: Natural language processing for commands
- **Predictive Optimization**: Resource allocation, caching, transcoding

    A[Media Input] --> B[Type Detection]
    B --> C[Metadata Extraction]
    C --> D[AI Analysis]
    D --> E[Quality Optimization]
    E --> F[Storage]
    F --> G[Streaming Engine]
```

### 2. Intelligent Resource Management
- **Dynamic Allocation**: CPU/GPU resources allocated based on real-time demand
