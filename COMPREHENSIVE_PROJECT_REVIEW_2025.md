## üîí Security Analysis

### Critical Vulnerabilities Found

üö® **SEVERITY: CRITICAL**
1. **Hardcoded API Keys Exposed**:
   ```yaml
   - Sonarr API Key: 79eecf2b23f34760b91cfcbf97189dd0
   - Radarr API Key: 1c0fe63736a04e6394dacb3aa1160b1c
   - Prowlarr API Key: 5a35dd23f90c4d2bb69caa1eb0e1c534
   ```

2. **Docker Socket Exposure**: Security risk from unrestricted socket access
3. **Missing Authentication**: Several services lack proper auth middleware
4. **Weak Network Segmentation**: All services on single network

### Immediate Actions Required
1. Remove all hardcoded API keys immediately
2. Regenerate all exposed keys
3. Implement environment variable management
4. Deploy provided Authelia configuration
5. Clean git history if secrets were committed

**Security Score: 3/10** (Due to critical vulnerabilities)

## üíª Code Quality Analysis

### Overview
- **Total Files Analyzed**: 85+
- **Overall Quality Score**: 6.5/10
- **Technical Debt**: 24-32 hours

### Major Issues
1. **Large Python Files**: 3 files exceed 1000 lines
2. **Code Duplication**: Identical functions across multiple files
3. **Generic Exception Handling**: Masks specific errors
4. **Shell Script Issues**: Missing error handling
5. **TypeScript Migration Needed**: JSX files lack type safety

### Positive Findings
- Good module organization
- Comprehensive logging
- Proper async/await usage
- Well-structured API integrations

**Code Quality Score: 6.5/10**

---

## ‚ö° Performance Analysis

### Key Findings
‚úÖ **Strengths**:
- Proper resource limits defined
- Comprehensive monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana
- Health checks for all services
- Concurrent processing in orchestrator
- Network isolation for performance

‚ö†Ô∏è **Bottlenecks**:
- Storage I/O not optimized for media scanning
- PostgreSQL needs tuning for Immich
- Transcoding blocks Jellyfin main thread
- No caching layer (Redis needed)
- Missing CDN for static assets

### Performance Improvements Potential: **40-70%**

**Performance Score: 7/10**

---

## üìö Documentation Analysis

### Coverage
- **30+ documentation files** covering all aspects
- Guides for all skill levels (beginner to advanced)
- Comprehensive security documentation
- Architecture diagrams and technical specs
- Troubleshooting and maintenance guides

### Assessment
‚úÖ **Exceptional**:
- Security documentation (2025 best practices)
- Multiple beginner-friendly guides
- Clear setup instructions
- Visual formatting and readability

‚ö†Ô∏è **Needs Improvement**:
- Some documentation redundancy
- Missing API reference docs
- No migration guides
- Cross-reference links needed

**Documentation Score: 8.5/10**

## üéØ Priority Recommendations

### üî¥ Critical (Immediate - 24 hours)
1. **Remove hardcoded API keys** from all configuration files
2. **Regenerate all exposed credentials**
3. **Implement secrets management** using environment variables
4. **Deploy authentication** with provided Authelia config

### üü° High Priority (1 week)
1. **Refactor large Python files** into smaller modules
2. **Add Redis caching** for performance
3. **Implement proper error handling** in shell scripts
4. **Create shared configuration module**

### üü¢ Medium Priority (2-4 weeks)
1. **Migrate to TypeScript** for type safety
2. **Deploy Tdarr** for transcoding offload
3. **Consolidate docker-compose** files
4. **Add comprehensive testing**

### üîµ Long Term (1-2 months)
1. **Implement service mesh** (Istio/Linkerd)
2. **Add message queue** (RabbitMQ/Kafka)
3. **Create CI/CD pipeline**
4. **Kubernetes migration** for better scaling

---

## üí° Next Steps
