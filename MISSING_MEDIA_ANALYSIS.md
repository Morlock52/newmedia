## Overview

After analyzing your current media server stack, I've identified several missing media types and applications that would significantly enhance your media ecosystem. This document outlines what's missing, why it's important, and how to add these applications to your stack.

## Current Media Stack Analysis

### ‚úÖ What You Already Have
- **Media Server**: Jellyfin

## üö® Missing Media Types (HIGH PRIORITY)

### 1. Audiobooks - AudioBookshelf
**Why Missing**: This is the #1 most requested missing media type in 2025
**Problem**: While Readarr handles e-books, audiobooks require different handling with:
- Chapter markers and bookmarks
- Progress tracking across devices
- Speed control and sleep timers
- Mobile apps optimized for audio

**Solution**: AudioBookshelf
- Dedicated audiobook server like "Audible but self-hosted"
- Mobile apps for iOS/Android
- Automatic chapter detection
- Progress syncing across devices
- Integration with metadata sources

**Access**: `https://audiobooks.${DOMAIN}`

### 2. Dedicated Music Streaming - Navidrome
**Why Missing**: Jellyfin music experience is subpar compared to dedicated music servers
**Problem**: 
- Poor mobile music experience in Jellyfin
- No Subsonic API support for music apps
- Limited music-specific features

**Solution**: Navidrome
- Subsonic API compatible (works with dozens of mobile apps)
- Built specifically for music streaming
- Lightweight and fast
- Last.fm scrobbling
- Smart playlists

**Access**: `https://music.${DOMAIN}`

### 3. Modern Photo Management - Immich
**Why Missing**: PhotoPrism is good but Immich has become the modern standard
**Problem**: 
- PhotoPrism can be resource heavy
- Immich has better mobile apps
- More active development and community

**Solution**: Immich
- Google Photos alternative with modern UI
- Excellent mobile apps with auto-backup
- AI-powered face recognition and object detection
- Timeline view and advanced search
- Better performance on mobile devices

**Access**: `https://photos.${DOMAIN}`

### 4. E-book Reading Experience - Calibre-Web
**Why Missing**: Readarr is for acquisition, not reading
**Problem**: 
- Readarr downloads books but doesn't provide reading interface
- No web-based e-book reader
- No user management for family sharing

**Solution**: Calibre-Web
- Web-based e-book reader
- Multiple format support (EPUB, PDF, etc.)
- User management and reading progress
- Send to Kindle functionality
- Better than just file downloads

**Access**: `https://books.${DOMAIN}`

### 5. File Processing & Conversion - FileFlows
**Why Missing**: No automated media file optimization
**Problem**: 
- Large file sizes consuming storage
- Inconsistent video/audio formats
- Manual file processing

**Solution**: FileFlows
- Automated media file processing
- Video encoding/transcoding workflows
- File organization and cleanup
- Hardware acceleration support
- Reduces storage usage significantly

**Access**: `https://fileflows.${DOMAIN}`

## üîß Additional Useful Applications

### 6. File Management - FileBrowser
**Purpose**: General file management and sharing
**Access**: `https://files.${DOMAIN}`

### 7. Recipe Management - Mealie
**Purpose**: Digital cookbook and meal planning
**Access**: `https://recipes.${DOMAIN}`

### 8. Documentation/Wiki - BookStack
**Purpose**: Personal/family knowledge base
**Access**: `https://wiki.${DOMAIN}`

## üìÅ Directory Structure Updates

With the new applications, your media directory structure should include:

```
media_data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ media/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ movies/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tv/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ music/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ photos/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ audiobooks/          # NEW: For AudioBookshelf
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ books/               # For Calibre-Web
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ comics/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ podcasts/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ online-videos/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ torrents/
```

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Quick Deploy (High Priority Only)
Deploy just the missing high-priority applications:

```bash
# Copy the enhanced docker-compose file
cp docker-compose-enhanced.yml docker-compose-priority.yml

# Edit to include only these services:
# - audiobookshelf
# - navidrome 
# - immich (all components)
# - calibre-web
# - fileflows

docker compose -f docker-compose-priority.yml up -d
```

### Option 2: Full Enhanced Stack
Deploy the complete enhanced stack:

```bash
# Use the enhanced compose file
docker compose -f docker-compose-enhanced.yml up -d
```

### Option 3: Gradual Migration
Add services one at a time to test:

```bash
# Start with audiobooks (most requested)
docker compose -f docker-compose-enhanced.yml up -d audiobookshelf

# Then add music streaming
docker compose -f docker-compose-enhanced.yml up -d navidrome

# Continue with others...
```

4. **Maintenance**: More applications to update and maintain
5. **Backup**: Include new volume mounts in backup strategy

## üéØ Priority Recommendations

If you can only add a few applications, prioritize:

1. **AudioBookshelf** - Fills the biggest gap in your media stack
2. **Navidrome** - Dramatically improves music experience
3. **FileFlows** - Saves storage and automates processing
4. **Immich** - Modern photo management with great mobile apps
5. **Calibre-Web** - Actually makes your e-books usable

## üìä Summary

**Missing Media Types Found**: 10 categories
**High Priority Applications**: 5 essential additions
**Additional Utilities**: 5 helpful applications
**Estimated Setup Time**: 2-4 hours for full implementation
**Impact**: Completes your media ecosystem for all major media types

Your current stack is excellent but missing these key media types. Adding these applications will give you a truly comprehensive, modern media server that rivals any commercial solution.

## üöÄ Quick Start Command

To deploy the high-priority missing applications immediately:

```bash
cd /Users/morlock/fun/newmedia
docker compose -f docker-compose-enhanced.yml up -d audiobookshelf navidrome immich-server immich-microservices immich-machine-learning immich-redis immich-postgres calibre-web fileflows
```

This will add audiobooks, better music streaming, modern photo management, e-book reading, and automated file processing to your stack!
