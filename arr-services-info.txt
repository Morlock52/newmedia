DOCKER CONTAINERS:
==================
All containers are running with health checks and automatic restart.
- Network: media-network (shared between all services)
- Volumes: Individual config volumes for each service
- Media Paths: /Users/morlock/fun/newmedia/media-data/

✓ Prowlarr connected to Radarr (Movie categories: 2000-2060)
✓ Prowlarr connected to Lidarr (Music categories: 3000-3040)

NEXT STEPS:
===========
1. Access each service through its web interface
2. Add indexers to Prowlarr (they will sync to other services)
3. Configure download clients in each service
4. Set up quality profiles and root folders
5. Start adding media to monitor

MANAGEMENT COMMANDS:
====================
View logs:         docker logs [service-name]
Restart service:   docker restart [service-name]
Stop all:          docker-compose -f docker-compose-arr-services.yml down
Start all:         docker-compose -f docker-compose-arr-services.yml up -d
Update services:   docker-compose -f docker-compose-arr-services.yml pull && docker-compose -f docker-compose-arr-services.yml up -d

TROUBLESHOOTING:
================
- All services have health checks that run every 30 seconds
- Logs are available in the container: docker logs [service-name]
- Config files are stored in Docker volumes
- Services auto-restart on failure
