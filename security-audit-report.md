# Security Audit Report - Media Server Project

**Date:** July 30, 2025  
**Auditor:** Security Analyst Agent  
**Severity:** CRITICAL

## Executive Summary

The security analysis has identified **CRITICAL security vulnerabilities** in the media server project that require immediate attention. The most severe issue is the presence of hardcoded API keys exposed in multiple configuration files, which poses a significant security risk.

## Critical Security Issues

### 1. üö® CRITICAL: Hardcoded API Keys in Configuration Files

**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**CVSS Score:** 9.8 (Critical)  
**Impact:** Complete compromise of application security

#### Findings:
- **Hardcoded API keys found in `docker-compose.yml`:**
  - Sonarr API Key: `79eecf2b23f34760b91cfcbf97189dd0` (line 90)
  - Radarr API Key: `1c0fe63736a04e6394dacb3aa1160b1c` (line 115)
  - Prowlarr API Key: `5a35dd23f90c4d2bb69caa1eb0e1c534` (line 139)

- **Same API keys exposed in `homepage-config/services.yaml`:**
  - Sonarr (line 36)
  - Radarr (line 46)
  - Prowlarr (line 56)
  - Overseerr API Key also exposed: `MTc1MzA0NTIyNTMxMDZhZmE3ZGYwLTIzZTktNGZlMy1iNmM3LTUwY2U0NTE3MjdhMw==`

#### Risk Analysis:
1. **Public Repository Exposure:** If this code is pushed to a public repository, these API keys become immediately accessible to attackers
2. **Service Compromise:** Attackers can use these keys to:
   - Access and control media management services
   - Download unauthorized content
   - Modify configurations
   - Potentially pivot to other services
3. **No Key Rotation:** Hardcoded keys cannot be easily rotated without code changes

#### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Remove all hardcoded API keys immediately**
2. **Regenerate all exposed API keys in the services**
3. **Implement proper secrets management using environment variables**
4. **Scan git history to ensure keys are not in previous commits**

### 2. ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH: Missing Authentication on Critical Services

**Severity:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Unauthorized access to services

#### Findings:
- Multiple services exposed without authentication middleware:
  - Homepage dashboard (port 3000)
  - Overseerr (port 5055) - Public facing without auth middleware
  - Several internal services rely only on API keys for security

#### Recommendations:
- Implement Traefik auth middleware for all services
- Consider implementing Authelia for centralized authentication
- Use OAuth2/OIDC for public-facing services

### 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH: Docker Socket Exposure

**Severity:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Container escape and host compromise

#### Findings:
- Docker socket mounted in multiple containers:
  - Homepage: `/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro`
  - Portainer: `/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro`

#### Risk:
- Containers with docker socket access can escape containment
- Potential for privilege escalation to host system
- Can manipulate other containers

#### Recommendations:
- Use Docker socket proxy with limited permissions
- Implement least-privilege access controls
- Consider alternatives that don't require socket access

### 4. üü° MEDIUM: Weak Network Segmentation

**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Lateral movement in case of compromise

#### Findings:
- All services on single `media_network` bridge network
- No network isolation between sensitive services
- VPN container shares network with download client only

#### Recommendations:
- Implement network segmentation:
  - Frontend network (public facing)
  - Backend network (internal services)
  - Database network (data layer)
  - Management network (admin tools)

### 5. üü° MEDIUM: Insufficient Secrets Management

**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Credential exposure

#### Findings:
- Environment variables used but not all secrets properly managed
- Example auth hash in `.env.example`
- VPN credentials in environment variables
- No secret rotation mechanism

#### Recommendations:
- Implement Docker secrets or external secret management
- Use tools like HashiCorp Vault or Docker Swarm secrets
- Implement regular secret rotation
- Never commit example credentials

## Security Architecture Improvements

### 1. Implement Zero-Trust Architecture
- Add mutual TLS between services
- Implement service mesh for secure communication
- Use certificate-based authentication

### 2. Enhanced Authentication & Authorization
- Deploy Authelia for centralized authentication
- Implement RBAC with the provided RBAC engine
- Enable MFA for administrative access
- Use OAuth2 proxy for services

### 3. Improved Container Security
```yaml
security_opt:
  - no-new-privileges:true
  - apparmor:docker-default
  - seccomp:default.json
cap_drop:
  - ALL
cap_add:
  - CHOWN
  - SETUID
  - SETGID
read_only: true
```

### 4. Network Security Enhancements
```yaml
networks:
  frontend:
    driver: bridge
    internal: false
  backend:
    driver: bridge
    internal: true
  database:
    driver: bridge
    internal: true
```

### 5. Secrets Management Template
```yaml
secrets:
  sonarr_api_key:
    external: true
  radarr_api_key:
    external: true
  prowlarr_api_key:
    external: true

services:
  sonarr:
    secrets:
      - sonarr_api_key
    environment:
      - API_KEY_FILE=/run/secrets/sonarr_api_key
```

## Compliance Considerations

### Security Standards Alignment:
- **OWASP Top 10:** Multiple violations including A07:2021 (Security Misconfiguration)
- **CIS Docker Benchmark:** Several Level 1 and Level 2 violations
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework:** Gaps in Identify, Protect, and Detect functions

## Priority Action Items

### Immediate (Within 24 hours):
1. ‚ùó Remove all hardcoded API keys from configuration files
2. ‚ùó Regenerate all exposed API keys in services
3. ‚ùó Implement environment variable substitution for all secrets
4. ‚ùó Review and clean git history for exposed secrets

### Short-term (Within 1 week):
1. üîß Implement authentication middleware for all services
2. üîß Set up proper network segmentation
3. üîß Configure security headers and CSP policies
4. üîß Implement rate limiting on all endpoints

### Medium-term (Within 1 month):
1. üìã Deploy centralized authentication (Authelia)
2. üìã Implement secrets management solution
3. üìã Set up security monitoring and alerting
4. üìã Conduct penetration testing

## Security Monitoring Recommendations

1. **Log Aggregation:** Implement centralized logging with the ELK stack
2. **Intrusion Detection:** Deploy Falco for runtime security
3. **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regular Trivy scans of container images
4. **Access Monitoring:** Track all API key usage and authentication attempts

## Conclusion

The media server project has significant security vulnerabilities that must be addressed immediately. The most critical issue is the hardcoded API keys, which represent a severe security risk. Implementing the recommended security controls will significantly improve the security posture of the application.

**Risk Rating: CRITICAL - Immediate action required**
