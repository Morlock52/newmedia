## 🛠️ Important Configuration Notes

### Volume Mapping Changes
- All services now use `/Volumes/Plex` as the media root
- Download clients save to `/Volumes/Plex/downloads`
- Media libraries point to specific subdirectories

### File Permissions
- Ensure `PUID=1000` and `PGID=1000` in `.env` match your system
- Volume must be writable by the configured user/group
- Test permissions: `touch /Volumes/Plex/test.txt && rm /Volumes/Plex/test.txt`

### Docker Compose
- Using `docker-compose-unified-2025.yml` for profile-based deployment
- Services grouped by function (core, media, automation, etc.)
- Health checks and dependencies configured

---

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

Before considering deployment complete, verify:

- [ ] `/Volumes/Plex` is accessible and writable
- [ ] All required directories are created
- [ ] Docker containers are running
- [ ] Services respond on their ports
- [ ] Volume mounts work inside containers
- [ ] ARR services can access media folders
- [ ] Media servers can scan libraries
- [ ] Download client can write to downloads folder

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Volume Issues
```bash
# Check if volume exists
ls -la /Volumes/Plex

# Test write permissions
touch /Volumes/Plex/test.txt && rm /Volumes/Plex/test.txt

# Fix permissions if needed
sudo chmod -R 755 /Volumes/Plex
sudo chown -R $(id -u):$(id -g) /Volumes/Plex
```

### Container Issues
```bash
# Check container status
docker ps

# View logs for specific service
docker logs jellyfin
docker logs sonarr

# Restart service
docker restart jellyfin
```

### Service Connectivity Issues
```bash
# Test port availability
nc -z localhost 8096  # Jellyfin
nc -z localhost 8989  # Sonarr
nc -z localhost 7878  # Radarr

# Check if services are binding correctly
docker port jellyfin
```

### Configuration Issues
```bash
# Verify environment variables
cat .env | grep -E "(MEDIA_PATH|DOWNLOADS_PATH)"

# Check Docker Compose configuration
docker compose config
```
