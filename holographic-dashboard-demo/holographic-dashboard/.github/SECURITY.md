# 🔒 Security Policy

## 🛡️ Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions of the Holographic Media Dashboard with security updates:

| Version | Supported          | Status |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------ |
| 2.0.x   | ✅ Yes             | Active development |
| 1.9.x   | ✅ Yes             | Security fixes only |
| 1.8.x   | ⚠️ Limited        | Critical fixes only |
| < 1.8   | ❌ No             | End of life |

## 🔍 Security Considerations

### 🌐 Client-Side Security
The Holographic Media Dashboard is primarily a client-side application that runs in web browsers. Key security considerations include:

- **WebGL Security**: All WebGL operations are sandboxed by the browser
- **Cross-Origin Requests**: Properly configured CORS policies
- **Content Security Policy**: CSP headers recommended for deployment
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized

### 🔌 WebSocket Security
- WebSocket connections should use WSS (secure WebSocket) in production
- Authentication tokens should be validated server-side
- Rate limiting should be implemented to prevent abuse
- Message validation prevents malicious data injection

### 📱 Deployment Security
- **HTTPS Only**: Always deploy over HTTPS in production
- **Secure Headers**: Implement security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)
- **Asset Integrity**: Use Subresource Integrity (SRI) for external dependencies
- **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated to latest secure versions

## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

### 📧 How to Report
We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

4. **Provide** updates on our remediation progress

## 🎯 Scope

### ✅ In Scope
Security issues in the following areas are within scope:

- **Core Dashboard Code**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS vulnerabilities
- **WebGL Renderer**: Shader injection, GPU-based attacks
- **WebSocket Client**: Connection hijacking, message injection
- **Build Process**: Supply chain attacks, malicious dependencies
- **Configuration**: Insecure default settings
- **Documentation**: Security misconfiguration guidance

### ❌ Out of Scope
The following are generally outside our scope:

- **Server Implementation**: We provide demo server only
- **Browser Vulnerabilities**: Issues in browsers themselves
- **Network Infrastructure**: DNS, TLS/SSL configuration
- **Physical Security**: Device access, hardware attacks
- **Social Engineering**: Phishing, pretexting attacks
- **DoS/DDoS**: Denial of service attacks
- **Brute Force**: Rate limiting is server responsibility

## 🛠️ Security Best Practices

### 🚀 For Developers
If you're contributing to the project:

- **Code Review**: All code changes require security review
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regularly scan for vulnerable dependencies
- **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs, especially from WebSocket
- **Output Encoding**: Properly encode all outputs
- **HTTPS Only**: Test in HTTPS environment
- **CSP Testing**: Verify Content Security Policy compliance

### 🌐 For Deployers
If you're deploying the dashboard:

- **Use HTTPS**: Always deploy over encrypted connections
- **Secure Headers**: Implement proper security headers
- **Regular Updates**: Keep the dashboard updated
- **WebSocket Security**: Use WSS and authenticate connections
- **Access Control**: Implement proper authentication/authorization
- **Monitoring**: Log and monitor for suspicious activity
