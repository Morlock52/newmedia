# 🚀 GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Complete GitHub Repository Setup for Holographic Media Dashboard

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up a professional GitHub repository for the Holographic Media Dashboard project.

### 🎯 Quick Setup (Automated)

**Use the setup script for automatic configuration:**

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x setup-github-repo.sh

# Run the setup script
./setup-github-repo.sh
```

The script will:
- Initialize Git repository with proper branch structure
- Create GitHub repository with optimal settings
- Configure GitHub Pages for live demo
- Create release v1.0.0 with professional description
- Set up community features and security settings
- Create organized labels for issue management

### 📋 Manual Setup (Step by Step)

If you prefer manual setup or the script encounters issues:

#### 1. 🔧 Local Git Setup

```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init
git branch -M main

# Configure git (if not already done)
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your.email@example.com"

# Add all files
git add .
git commit -m "🎬 Initial commit: Holographic Media Dashboard v1.0.0

✨ Features:
- 3D holographic interface with Three.js
- WebGL particle systems and custom shaders  
- Real-time audio visualizer
- WebSocket integration for live data
- Responsive design with glass morphism UI
- Performance optimization for all devices
- Comprehensive documentation

🚀 Ready for production deployment!"
```

#### 2. 🌐 GitHub Repository Creation
