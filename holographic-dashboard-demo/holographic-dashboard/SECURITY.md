## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of the Holographic Media Dashboard seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### Reporting Process

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an email to: [security@yourdomain.com](mailto:security@yourdomain.com)

Include the following information:
- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of report
- **Assessment**: Within 1 week  
- **Fix Development**: Timeline depends on severity
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released and deployed

### Security Measures

The Holographic Media Dashboard implements several security measures:

#### Content Security Policy (CSP)
```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="
    default-src 'self';
    script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com;
    style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
    img-src 'self' data: https:;
    connect-src 'self' ws: wss:;
    font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com;
    worker-src 'self' blob:;
">
```

#### Input Sanitization
All user inputs and WebSocket messages are sanitized to prevent XSS attacks.

#### Secure WebSocket
Production deployments should use WSS (WebSocket Secure) for encrypted communication.

#### HTTPS Enforcement
The application requires HTTPS in production for security features to work properly.

### Known Security Considerations

#### WebGL Security
- WebGL contexts can be fingerprinted for tracking
- Shaders run on GPU and could potentially cause driver crashes
- We implement WebGL best practices and context validation

#### WebSocket Security
- All WebSocket messages are validated and sanitized
- Connection limits prevent DoS attacks
- Authentication should be implemented on the server side

#### Browser Security
- Modern browsers provide sandboxing for WebGL operations
- Content Security Policy limits potential attack vectors
- No persistent storage of sensitive data

### Best Practices for Deployment

1. **Use HTTPS**: Always deploy over HTTPS in production
2. **Validate Server-Side**: Implement proper authentication and validation on your WebSocket server
3. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated
4. **Network Security**: Use firewalls and network security measures
5. **Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring for suspicious activity

### Third-Party Dependencies

We regularly audit our dependencies for known vulnerabilities:
- Three.js: WebGL rendering library
- WebSocket (ws): Node.js WebSocket implementation

### Security Features

#### Client-Side Protection
- Input sanitization for all user data
- XSS prevention in dynamic content
- CSRF protection for any form submissions
- Safe parsing of WebSocket messages

#### Network Security
- WebSocket message validation
- Rate limiting support (server implementation required)
- Connection timeout handling
- Secure random number generation

#### Privacy
- No tracking scripts or analytics by default
- LocalStorage used only for user preferences
- No sensitive data stored client-side
- Optional telemetry (can be disabled)

### Vulnerability Disclosure

Once a security vulnerability has been resolved, we will:

1. Release a security update
2. Publish a security advisory
3. Credit the reporter (if desired)
4. Document the issue in our security log

### Security Contact

For security-related questions or concerns:
- Email: security@yourdomain.com
- GPG Key: [Public key link if available]

### Legal

By reporting a vulnerability, you agree to:
- Allow us reasonable time to fix the issue before public disclosure
- Not access or modify data that doesn't belong to you
- Not perform any attack that could harm our users or systems
- Not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we've addressed it

We commit to:
- Respond to your report within 48 hours
- Keep you updated on our progress
- Credit you for the discovery (if desired)
- Not pursue legal action against good-faith security research
